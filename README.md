#Federated Learning with Differential Privacy: Experimental Code

This repository contains code for experimenting with Federated Learning (FL) incorporating Differential Privacy (DP) on the MNIST digits dataset. The experiments aim to investigate the impact of IID and non-IID datasets on the performance of FL with DP, as well as to explore the privacy-convergence tradeoff.
